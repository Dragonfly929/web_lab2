            <h2>About Vincent van Gogh</h2>
            <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, and are characterized by bold colors and dramatic, impulsive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.</p>
            <p>Van Gogh struggled with mental health issues throughout his life, and his fame grew only after his death. He experienced periods of depression and fits of mental instability, which led to his eventual suicide at the age of 37. Despite his struggles, van Gogh's artistic legacy lives on, and his works continue to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.</p>

                <h1>The Sower</h1>
                <p>The Sower is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in 1888, it depicts a peasant sowing seeds in a field. The painting is part of a series of works van Gogh created on the theme of sowers, inspired by the rural life he observed during his time in Arles, France. The Sower reflects van Gogh's interest in depicting the dignity and toil of working-class individuals, as well as his fascination with the cycle of life and growth.</p>
